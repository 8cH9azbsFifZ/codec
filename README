Codec 2 README
--------------

Codec 2 is an open source 2400 bit/s speech codec (LGPL licensed).
For more information please see:

    http://rowetel.com/codec2.html

Quickstart
----------

$ ./configure
$ make
$ cd src
$ ./c2enc ../raw/hts1a.raw hts1a_c2.bit
$ ./c2dec hts1a_c2.bit hts1a_c2.raw 
$ ../script/menu.sh ../raw/hts1a.raw hts1a_c2.raw

For playback testing, menu.sh requires either the 'play', 'aplay' or
'ossplay' programs to be installed (see http://sox.sourceforge.net/,
http://www.alsa-project.org/, or http://www.opensound.com/ respectively).

To enable dump files build using:

$ make clean
$ CFLAGS=-DDUMP ./configure
$ make

Programs
--------

1/ c2enc encodes a file of speech sample to a file of encoded bits.

2/ c2dec decodes a file of bits to a file of speech samples.

3/ c2sim is a simulation/development version of codec 2.  It allows
selective use of the various codec 2 algorithms.  For example
switching phase modelling or LSP quantisation on and off.
