TODO for codec2
---------------

Planned tasks and half formed ideas for codec2.....

[X] Convert files from DOS to Unix
[X] Get sinenc and sinedec to build and run under gcc
[ ] refactor
    [ ] each source file has it's own header
    [ ] no globals
    [ ] Consistent file headers
    [X] GPL2 notice in each file
[ ] Replace Numerical Recipes in C (NRC) four1.c and four1.h with Gnu
    Science Lib (GSL) SL FFT as NRC code has restrictive licencing
[ ] A way to handle m=1 harmonic for males when LPC modelling
[ ] Is BW expansion and Rk noise floor required before LSP quant
[ ] test split VQ to make sure no silly errors
    + for example test MSE or index historgram for training data

[ ] Go through papers referenced in thesis and credit various
    techniques to papers.
      + sure there was somthing about zero phase synthesis is those papers

[ ] voicing errors can be clearly seen in synthesised speech using pl2.m

[ ] Voicing improvement
    + voicing tracker, if enery about the same in frame n-1,n,n+1, and n-1, n+1
      are voiced then make frame n voiced.

[ ] mmt1 with zero phase model
    + male with lots of background noise
    + zero order synth model sounds more "clicky" on mmt1, this suggests less
      dispersion
    + could be due to IRS filtering or background noise
    + exploring this could lead to better understanding on phase, e.g. add
      noise to clean samples and explore effect on zero phase model
    + wrote plphase.m to start analysing this
