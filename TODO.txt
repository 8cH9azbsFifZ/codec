TODO for codec2
---------------

[ ] Important Open Issues
    [X] Why zero phase model doesn't work for mmt1
        + error in LPC window and accidental random phase component and
          effect of background noise on interformant harmonics
    [X] residual noise on zero phase model
        + "navy" on hts1a, "frog" on morig
        + perhaps due to mis-alignment of phases at frame boundaries?
        + or possibly pitch errors
        + need a way to research this
    [X] Pitch errors on mmt1, morig
        + we may need a tracker
        + suggest manually step through each file, check for
          pitch errors, design tracker and check again
        + or develop manual pitch tracks and check estimator
          with tracker against these.
    [X] removal of LPC modelling errors for males
        + first few haromic energies (e.g. mmt1, hts1a) get raised
        + added a single bit to compensate for these errors, works OK
    [X] good quality LSP quantisation of {Am}
        + first pass at this, lots of futher work ideas below...
    [ ] conversion to 20ms frames
        + without significant distortion

[ ] Planned tasks and half formed ideas for codec2.....
    [X] Convert files from DOS to Unix
    [X] Get sinenc and sinedec to build and run under gcc
    [ ] refactor
        [ ] each source file has it's own header
        [ ] no globals
        [ ] Consistent file headers
        [X] GPL2 notice in each file
    [ ] Replace Numerical Recipes in C (NRC) four1.c and four1.h with Gnu
        Science Lib (GSL) SL FFT as NRC code has restrictive licencing
    [X] A way to handle m=1 harmonic for males when LPC modelling
        + used a single bit to correct LPC modelling errors
    [ ] Is BW expansion and Rk noise floor required before LSP quant?
        + initial tests lead to large LPC modelling errors
    [ ] Go through papers referenced in thesis and credit various
        techniques to papers.
      + sure there was something about zero phase synthesis is those papers
    [ ] voicing errors can be clearly seen in synthesised speech using pl2.m
    [ ] Voicing improvement idea
        + voicing tracker, if enery about the same in frame n-1,n,n+1, and n-1, n+1
          are voiced then make frame n voiced.

    [ ] mmt1 with zero phase model
        + male with lots of background noise
        + zero order synth model sounds more "clicky" on mmt1, this suggests less
          dispersion
        + could be due to IRS filtering or background noise
        + exploring this could lead to better understanding on phase, e.g. add
          noise to clean samples and explore effect on zero phase model
        + wrote plphase.m to start analysing this

    [ ] LSP quantisation further work
        + need codebook search to match perceptual error
        + for example error in close LSPs has a large perceptual effect
        + PDF-optimised quantisation may not be ideal, check this assumption
        + test split VQ to make sure no silly errors
        + for example test MSE or index histogram for training data
        + this gets tricky with split codebooks
        + VQ could also be trained with perceptual distortion modelled
        + perhaps work on weighting function
        + try differential in time as well, voiced speech doesn't chnage much
        + LPC envelope (mag spectrum) could possibly be quantised using some
	  other form of VQ, use LPC just to get a constant sampling rate.  This
          is a bit blue sky

    [ ] Blue Sky {Am} Spectral Envelope quantisation ideas #1
        + what is really important is location of formants
        + therefore how about we just locate peak of each format
          and encode position and height, then interpolate between them
        + could perhaps locate anti-formants as half way and just encode
	  depth
        + interesting factoid: a gentle HP of LP (3-6dB/oct) wont affect
          subjective quality much, but would have a big impact on
          quantisation error measures.  Maybe remove/normalise out
          before before quantisation?  Could try quantisation
          with/without HP filter.  
        + envelope could be time domain LPC or some other interpolation
	  technique (see #2 below)

    [ ] Blue Sky {Am} Spectral Envelop quantisation ideas #2
        + encode spectral envelope directly
	+ problem is variable number of harmonics L
        + use a pitch sync DFT, ie DFT of one pitch cycle to get continuous
	  envelope without harmonic pitch structure
        + then over sample this DFT to up/down sample to an appropriate rate
	+ we effectively already have pitch-sync DFT in {Am}
        + they could be interpolated at a non-uniform rate, like a bark scale
        + can we somehow seperately encode shape and height?
